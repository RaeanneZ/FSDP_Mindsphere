# React + Vite

  

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

  

Currently, two official plugins are available:

  

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  

# Notes

Need to first `cd` into **both** frontend and backend folder and `npm install` in **both** the folders

Then in the **frontend** folder, you have to run npm run build to make a set build for the backend to use the frontend pages

To run the **backend and frontend** at the same time run this in the root folder in terminal

 `npm run dev`

To only run **frontend** follow the step in terminal

 1. `cd frontend`
 2. `npm run dev`
 
To only run **backend** follow the step in terminal

1. `cd backend`
2. `node server.js` 
 
To terminate the server enter **CTRL+C** in terminal
